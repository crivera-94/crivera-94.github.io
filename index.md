# About Me

Hi! My name is Carlos Rivera and I am currently a graduate computer science and engineering student and teaching assistant at [Santa Clara University](https://www.scu.edu/engineering/academic-programs/department-of-computer-engineering/). I've been fortunate enough to have worked with some amazing people at the following places: [NASA Ames Research Center](https://www.nasa.gov/ames), Stellar Solution's [QuakeFinder](https://www.quakefinder.com/), and [Lyft](https://www.lyft.com). 

So what am I up to right now? Aside from working towards my goal of becoming a proficient C++ developer, I've recently been tinkering around with iOS development and drone automation. I've also found an interest in languages (not the programming kind) and have been learning a new one on my downtime!

Lastly, this site is still under construction so stay tuned! I'm also always excited to meet new people so definitely drop me a line if I've piqued your interest and you'd like to chat. In the meantime though, here is my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Olwvm9Xk2vxNDhpO7tTuzG2gSpl-6dcI/view?usp=sharing) :)
