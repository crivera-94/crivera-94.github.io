# About Me

Hi! My name is Carlos Rivera and I am currently a graduate computer science and engineering student and teaching assistant at [Santa Clara University](https://www.scu.edu/engineering/academic-programs/department-of-computer-engineering/). I've been fortunate enough to have worked with some amazing people at [NASA Ames Research Center](https://www.nasa.gov/ames) and Stellar Solution's [QuakeFinder](https://www.quakefinder.com/) in the past. I'll also be interning at a really awesome company this summer so I'm very excited about that!

So what am I up to right now? Well, aside from looking for my next challenge (a Fall 2018 software engineering internship!), I've been recently tinkering around with iOS development and drone automation. I've also found an interest in languages (not the programming kind) and have been learning a new one on my downtime!

Lastly, this site is still under construction so stay tuned! I'm also always excited to meet new people so definitely drop me a line if I've piqued your interest and you'd like to chat. In the meantime though, here is my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zLD1shGcPlIboVeFkxsNZOIM2tR_8lm1/view?usp=sharing) :)
