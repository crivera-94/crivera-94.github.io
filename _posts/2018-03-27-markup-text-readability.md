안녕하세요! So since this is my very first post, I'll try to keep it short.

tl;dr I'm currently refreshing and revamping my iOS/macOS development knowledge, learning Korean, and having a blast teaching.

## iOS Development

Why iOS? Excellent question! I was messing around with iOS development a while back (about 2.5 years ago) and set it aside to get better acquainted with Python and C++. I've been itching to get back to iOS and with Swift 4, CoreML, ARKit, and a whole bunch of new features, I think it's the right time. So why else am I going back to it?

  * I personally think Swift is a really pretty language.
  * Coming from a largely strongly typed language background, the optional chaining, nil coalescing, etc. features of Swift are amazing.
  * I think my knowledge of C and C++ will help me with undelrying memory management in Objective-C/Swift.
  * I'll be able to reach the iPhone userbase.
  * All the new features I've mentioned.
  * It's always fun to learn something new :)

In the past, I learned about Java because I wanted to learn Android programming. Upon diving a bit further into Java and finding out more about it's design, I found that it wasn't really to my liking. Weirdly enough, I was interested with the application runtime environment and after finding out about the gripes/limitations of Dalvik and its successor, Android Runtime, I thought it was unfortunate that Android's design meant that it would require more resources than that of iOS to accomplish a given task. This, amongst a couple of other constraints, drove me away from Android.

The fact that iOS's design allows for programs to run natively on the iPhone's ARM processor makes a lot of sense and this knowledge of optimization and strength in design is what drove me to this platform. I could rant on more and more on this topic, but I'll leave it at that for brevity's sake.

All in all, while Swift and following best software development practices is my primary focus, I'm also learning Objective-C and making sure I develop a well-rounded foundation. Looking forward to seeing where my iOS and macOS deep dive will take me!

## Learning Korean

So to be completely honest, I started learning Korean back in October. Between the job hunt, school, teaching, research, and side projects, it's certainly been the topic I've put most often on the backburner.

> This is just a test of this feature and will be removed soon :)

As of now I've covered hangeul, studied basic vocabulary, and basic sentence structure. I'm working on grammar right now and aim to dedicate more time to this interest of mine. It's funny, I have A LOT to learn about Korean yet I'm already excited to tackle my next language (spoiler: it's Mandarin). That of course will be once I am able to dedicate more time to my language goals.

## Teaching Assistantship

So I've completed my second quarter as a teaching assistant. It's definitely been an amazing learning experience. I never realized just how much teaching would help my own knowledge. As of now I've TAed the following courses and will probably go into more detail in another post:

  * COEN 12: Abstract Data Types and Data Structures
  * COEN 146: Computer Networks
  * COEN 160: Object-Oriented Analysis, Design, and Programming

That's it for now. I'll try to remain consistent with my posts, but we'll see :). 안녕히 가세요!
